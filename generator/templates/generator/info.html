    <h3 class = 'alert alert-warning'>This is web-site which function is generation of passwords. <br>It was created by me, Roma Kozlov. I'm a genious and very modest programmer, I have created this password generator as traning on Stepik's course, but exactly this page was created as homework on this course. To do this homework I need to create new page where I also need to write some information, so I will write here all stupid things, which are coming in my head. <br>To be honest it is my first web-site. But creating of passwords it is very interesting theme to studying as for me. <br>I guess, I will use web-site code and this new experience to create my school project. <br>And also while I'm writing this text in the moment I'm listening to Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody :D <br> One Ring to rule them all,<br> One Ring to find them, <br>One Ring to bring them all<br>And in the Darkness bind them.<br> or if translate in orkish: <br>Ash nazg durbatulûk,<br>Ash nazg gimbatul,<br>Ash nazg thrakatulûk,<br>Agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.<br></h3>
